                  In November 2010, the first class was inducted into the Norwell High School Athletic Hall of Fame. Every two years, we add to the great tradition and induct a new class to the Hall of Fame.

                <p>
                  Our committee is comprised of former and present Norwell High School student-athletes, coaches, parents, faculty, and fans and supporters of Clipper athletics. We have all seen first hand the value of high school athletics to both the student-athletes themselves, and to our community as a whole.

                  It is our pleasure to honor these men and women and to welcome them to the Norwell High School Athletic Hall of Fame.
